Premise:
I'll be asking you some questions about device driver development for Linux. I've been reading the Linux device drivers third edition book and I now I would like the most up-to-date for the more recent kernels. In your answers, please cite your sources of information and keep them authoritative.

Q:
Looking at the kernel source I see that a lot of drivers have a core.c file. What should be contained within this file?

Q:
What are the APIs that can be use to interface with the sysfs nodes? In other words, how do I register, read from or write to these nodes from the character device?

Q:
how do i assign permissions to a device node created by device_create?
